              <p>During and after my MBA studies I worked for Hamilton College, a private four-year liberal arts college located
                in Upstate NY. Following my years at Hamilton College I joined a small but fast growing company focused on
                technology training to organizations across North America. Webucator has provided training to over 60% of
                the Fortune 100 companies, and was on the Inc. 5000 list for three years. As Chief Technology Officer I provide
                the technical solutions and strategies.</p>

            <p>I am currently the Chief Technology Officer for Webucator, Inc. We are a small company that delivers on-location
              and online technical and business training. We all work from home, but the company is centered in Syracuse,
              NY. As the CTO I manage the web development and information technology services. This includes several internal
              systems, as well as several external systems that are used by clients, trainers, partners and vendors.</p>

            <p>At Webucator, I built the web systems that run our business from the ground up using Object-oriented design principles,
              including a custom MVC framework that reduces cycles of development work on a daily basis. I create solutions
              that meet the business objectives and operational flow of our business using a variety of languages and resources.</p>

            <p>I also designed and built a private cloud to provide Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) to our Microsoft training
              clients enabling them to have customized online environments for lab exercises. This was built from the ground
              up using multiple fall-over virtualization servers using Hyper-V using a SAN with over 20TB of usable storage.</p>
